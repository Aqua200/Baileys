# Enhanced Signal Implementation for Baileys

This document explains how to use the enhanced signal implementation to fix encryption issues, particularly the "Bad MAC" errors that can occur due to race conditions and improper handling of pre-keys.

## Problem

The original implementation of the signal protocol in Baileys has several issues:

1. Lack of proper mutex locks in critical sections, leading to race conditions
2. Improper handling of pre-keys, which can be unexpectedly deleted
3. Transaction handling that doesn't properly protect against concurrent access

These issues can lead to "Bad MAC" errors during message decryption, which typically occur when the keys used for encryption and decryption don't match.

## Solution

The enhanced implementation adds:

1. Per-key type mutexes to prevent concurrent access to the same key type
2. Per-key mutexes to prevent concurrent access to the same key
3. Improved transaction handling with proper locking
4. Special handling for pre-keys to prevent unexpected deletion

## How to Use

To use the enhanced signal implementation, modify your code to use the `makeEnhancedLibSignalRepository` function instead of the default `makeLibSignalRepository`:

```javascript
const { makeWASocket, makeEnhancedLibSignalRepository } = require('baileys')

// Create a socket with the enhanced signal repository
const socket = makeWASocket({
    // ... your other options
    makeSignalRepository: makeEnhancedLibSignalRepository
})
```

## Implementation Details

The enhanced implementation:

1. Uses the `async-mutex` package to create locks for different resources
2. Adds transaction capability with proper locking
3. Prevents pre-keys from being unexpectedly deleted
4. Ensures atomic operations for critical signal operations

## Benefits

Using the enhanced implementation should:

1. Reduce or eliminate "Bad MAC" errors
2. Improve stability of encrypted communications
3. Prevent session corruption due to race conditions
4. Make the library more robust in high-concurrency environments

## Compatibility

This implementation is fully compatible with the existing API and should be a drop-in replacement for the default signal repository.
